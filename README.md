# text-clustering_bisecting-k-means
Implemented bisecting k-means algorithm for Text clustering.

Data preprocessing steps - 1. converted documents into sparse matrix\n
                           2. scale and normalization - TF-IDF\n
                           3. Dimensionality reduction - PCA\n

Bisecting k-means - for cluster analysis

SSE - to calculate variation within the cluster

Internal Evaluation metric - Silhouette Coefficient
